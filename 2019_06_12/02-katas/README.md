## Requirements

1. Using the starter code provided in `IterateAndPrint`, iterate through and print out all keys in the `Map`.
1. Using the starter code providedin `IterateAndPrint`, iterate through and print out all values in the `Map`.
1. Using the starter code providedin `IterateAndPrint`, iterate through the Entry Set of the `Map` and print both the keys and values in the `Map`.
1. In a Java file called `MapFun` complete the following:
    1. Create a `HashMap` with a string key and integer value
    1. Add the following key value pairs to the `Map`

        |       Key       |       Value       |
        |-----------------|-------------------|
        | Toyota Camry    |       2012        |

        | Pontiac GTO     |       1964        |

    1. Print out all key/value pairs in the `Map`
    1. Add two new entries to the `Map` - a 2012 Ford Explorer and a 2013 Smart Fortwo.
    1. Print out all key/value pairs in the `Map`
    1. Remove the Jeep Wrangler from the `Map`
    1. Print out all key/value pairs in the `Map`
1. Using the starter code provided in `CarLists`, complete the following:
    1. Create a `List` called `toyotaList` to hold all the `Car` variables with "Toyota" as the manufacturer and add them to the List.
    1. Create a `List` called `fordList` to hold all the `Car` variables with "Ford" as the manufacturer and add them to the List.
    1. Create a `List` called `hondaList` to hold all the `Car` variables with "Honda" as the manufacturer and add them to the List.
    1. Store all 3 `List` in a `Map` with the manufacturer as the key.

_Hint_: Your key will be a `String`. What will your value be?

### Challenge
