Bob Trieste answers to Reflection Questions on the Amazon ERD exercise.

Reflection Questions after Amazon  database design documented using a Draw.io
ER diagram along with a copy of the group ERD.


What was the most difficult part of this model?
      I think one aspect to be addressed is what pieces of data belong in
      each step of the process. For example the "tags" to be applied to each
      piece of the metadata and what primary key should be used.

What change along the way presented the biggest challenge?
      The harder part was determining what elements belong to each field in
      terms of both deciding the "primary key" and which if any "foreign keys"
      would be helpful to tie together important data. Additionally, the Amazon
      Modeling example was a good lesson in the use case in the merits of a
      "composite primary key".


How difficult or easy was it to change your model midstream?
      The good news was to see by way of the ER diagram we could
      "re-draw" lines of flow and connection.


Where there any columns on which your team didn't agree on a data type?
      It was a good exercise to realize that something like a "customer telephone
      number, although made up of "numeric" values, could really be looked at
      as text because it is not an element we will do computations on, rather an
      identifying piece of information that we do not want to change.
